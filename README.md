## Game description:
The game creates a series of tones and lights out of four colored buttons and requires the user to repeat the sequence.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
## Skills used in the project:
* Python
* SQL - saving users' scores with SQLite
* Design patterns - MVC, Memento (used for previous level management), OOP.
* Functional programming
